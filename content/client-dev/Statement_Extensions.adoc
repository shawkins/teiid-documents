= Statement Extensions

The Teiid statement extension interface, `org.teiid.jdbc.TeiidStatement`, provides functionality beyond the JDBC standard. To use the extension interface, simply cast or unwap the statement returned by the Connection. The following methods are provided on the extension interface:

.*Connection Properties*
|===
|Method Name |Description

|`getAnnotations`
|Get the query engine annotations if the statement was last executed with SHOWPLAN ON/DEBUG. Each `org.teiid.client.plan.Annotation` contains a description, a category, a severity, and possibly a resolution of notes recorded during query planning that can be used to understand choices made by the query planner.

|`getDebugLog`
|Get the debug log if the statement was last executed with SHOWPLAN DEBUG.

|`getExecutionProperty`
|Get the current value of an execution property on this statement object.

|`getPlanDescription`
|Get the query plan description if the statement was last executed with SHOWPLAN ON/DEBUG. The plan is a tree made up of `org.teiid.client.plan.PlanNode` objects. Typically `PlanNode.toString()` or `PlanNode.toXml()` will be used to convert the plan into a textual form.

|`getRequestIdentifier`
|Get an identifier for the last command executed on this statement. If no command has been executed yet, null is returned.

|`setExecutionProperty`
|Set the execution property on this statement. See the link:Execution_Properties.adoc[Execution Properties] section for more information. It is generally preferable to use the link:SET_Statement.adoc[SET Statement] unless the execution property applies only to the statement being executed.

|`setPayload`
|Set a per-command payload to pass to translators. Currently the only built-in use is for sending hints for Oracle data source.
