= Socket Transports

Teiid separates the configuration of its socket transports for JDBC and ODBC. Typical installations will not need to adjust the default thread and buffer size settings. The default values for _input-buffer-size_ and _output-buffer-size_ are set to 0, which will use the system default. Before adjusting these values, keep in mind that each JDBC/ODBC connection will create a new socket. Setting these values to a large buffer size should only be done if the number of clients are constrained. All JDBC/ODBC socket operations are non-blocking, so setting the number of _max-socket-threads_ higher than the maximum effective parallelism of the machine should not result in greater performance. The default value 0 indicates the system default of 2 * available processors will be used.

NOTE: If you are using more than the 2 default socket transports on a machine with a high number of actual or virtual cores, you may need to consider manually configuring the max threads for each to transport to cut down on the number of threads created.

JDBC clients may need to adjust low-level transport values, in addition to link:../client-dev/SSL_Client_Connections.adoc[SSL Client Connection] properties via a teiid-client-settings.properties file. This file also contains buffer, socket pooling, and maxObjectSize (effectively the maximum response size) settings.
