= Clustering in Teiid

Since Teiid is installed in {{ book.asName }}, there is no additional configuration needed beyond what was performed when Teiid is setup in Domain Mode. See the Domain Mode section in the Teiid link:Installation_Guide.adoc[Installation Guide]. Just make sure that you installed Teiid in every {{ book.asName }} node and started all {{ book.asName }} instances in the Domain mode that to be a part of the cluster.

Typically users create clusters to improve the performance of the system through:

* *Load Balancing*: Take look at <<HAProxy>> below and in the link:../client-dev/Using_Multiple_Hosts.adoc[Client Developer’s Guide] on how to use simple load balancing between multiple nodes.
* *Fail Over*: Take look at the link:../client-dev/Using_Multiple_Hosts.adoc[Client Developer’s Guide] on how to use fail over between multiple nodes.
* *Distributed Caching*: This is automatically done for you once you configure it as specified above. 
* *Event distribution*: metadata and data modifications will be distributed to all cluster members.

In the _Domain_ mode, the only way a user can deploy any artifacts is using either CLI or using the Admin API. Copying VDB directly into the "deployments" directory is not supported.

[[HAProxy]]
== HAProxy

HAProxy may be used for load-balancing and high availability.  A good tutorial is located at link:http://blog.everythingjboss.org/articles/Load-Balancing-JDV-HAProxy/[Load Balancing JDV-HAProxy] or see link:https://github.com/foogaro/jdv-play[Luigi Fugaro's example].

The load balancer should use an algorithm that supports sticky connections as Teiid sessions as specific to the original host.  For HAProxy it is recommended that you use leastconn or source.
