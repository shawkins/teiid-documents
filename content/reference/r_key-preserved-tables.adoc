= Key-preserved tables

A key-preserved table has a primary or unique key that remains unique when it is projected into the result of the query. 
Note that it is not actually required for a view to reference the key columns in the SELECT clause. 
The query engine can detect a key-preserved table by analyzing the join structure. 
The engine will ensure that a join of a key-preserved table must be against one of its foreign keys.
