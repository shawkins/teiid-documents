= Connections to Source

== Obtaining connections

The extended "ExecutionFactory" must implement the `getConnection()` method to allow the Connector Manager to obtain a connection.

== Releasing Connections

Once the Connector Manager has obtained a connection, it will use that connection only for the lifetime of the request. Â When the request has completed, the closeConnection() method called on the "ExecutionFactory". You must also override this method to properly close the connection.

In cases (such as when a connection is stateful and expensive to create), connections should be pooled. If the resource adapter is JEE JCA connector based, then pooling is automatically provided by the {{ book.asName }} container. If your resource adapter does not implement the JEE JCA, then connection pooling semantics are left to the user to define on their own.
