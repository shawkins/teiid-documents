= Deployment

A translator JAR file can be deployed into {{ book.productnameFull }} Server in two different ways

== As {{ book.asName }} module

Create a module under "jboss-as/modules" directory and define the translator name and module name in the teiid subsystem in _standalone-teiid.xml_ file or _domain-teiid.xml_ file and restart the server. The dependent {{ book.productnameFull }} or any other java class libraries must be defined in module.xml file of the module. For production profiles this is recommended.

== As JAR deployment

For development time or quick deployment you can deploy the translator JAR using the CLI or AdminAPI or admin console programs. When you deploy in JAR form the dependencies to {{ book.productnameFull }} java libraries and any other third party libraries must be defined under _META-INF/MANIFEST.MF_ file.
