= Developer’s Guide

This guide contains information for developers creating custom solutions with {{ book.productnameFull }}. It covers creating JEE JCA connectors with the {{ book.productnameFull }} framework, {{ book.productnameFull }} Translators, {{ book.productnameFull }} User Defined Functions (UDFs) as well as related topics.

Integrating data from a Enterprise Information System (EIS) into {{ book.productnameFull }}, is separated into two parts.

1.  A Translator, which is required.
2.  An optional Resource Adapter, which will typically be a JCA Resource Adapter (also called a JEE Connector)

*A Translator is used to:*

* Translate a {{ book.productnameFull }}-specific command into a native command
* Execute the command
* Return batches of results translated to expected {{ book.productnameFull }} types.

*A Resource Adapter is used to:*

* Handles all communications with individual enterprise information system (EIS), which can include databases, data feeds, flat files, etc.
* Can be a JCA Connector or any other custom connection provider. The reason {{ book.productnameFull }} recommends and uses JCA is this specification defines how one can write, package, and configure access to EIS system in consistent manner. There are also various commercial/open source software vendors already providing JCA Connectors to access a variety of back-end systems. Refer to http://java.sun.com/j2ee/connector/[http://java.sun.com/j2ee/connector/].
* Abstracts Translators from many common concerns, such as connection information, resource pooling, or authentication. + Given a combination of a Translator + Resource Adapter, one can connect any EIS system to {{ book.productnameFull }} for their data integration needs.

== Do You Need a New Translator?

{{ book.productnameFull }} provides several translators for common enterprise information system types. If you can use one of these enterprise information systems, you do not need to develop a custom one.

{{ book.productnameFull }} offers numerous built-in translators, including:

* *JDBC Translator* - Works with many relational databases. The JDBC translator is validated against the following database systems: Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, IBM DB2, MySQL, Postgres, Derby, Sybase, SQP-IQ, H2, and HSQL. In addition, the JDBC Translator can often be used with other 3rd-party drivers and provides a wide range of extensibility options to specialize behavior against those drivers.

* *File Translator* - Provides a procedural way to access the file system to handle text files.

* *WS Translator* - Provides procedural access to XML content using Web Services.

* *LDAP Translator* - Accesses to LDAP directory services.

* *Salesforce Translator* - Works with Salesforce interfaces.

To see a full list of available translators, see link:../reference/as_translators.adoc[Translators]

If there’s not an available translator that meets your need, {{ book.productnameFull }} provides the framework for developing your own custom translator. See the link:Translator_Development.adoc[Translator Development] section, as it will describe how to develop, package and deploy a custom developed translator.

== Do You Need a New Resource Adapter?

As mentioned above, for every Translator that needs to gather data from external source systems, it requires a resource adapter.

The following are some of resource adapters that are available to {{ book.productnameFull }}:

* _DataSource:_ This is provided by the {{ book.asName }} container. This is used by the JDBC Translator.

* _File:_ Provides a JEE JCA based Connector to access defined directory on the file system. This is used by the File Translator

* _WS:_ Provides JEE JCA Connector to invoke Web Services using {{ book.asName }} Web services stack. This is used by the WS Translator

* _LDAP:_ Provides JEE JCA connector to access LDAP; Used by the LDAP Translator.

* _Salesforce:_ Provides JEE JCA connector to access Salesforce by invoking their Web Service interface. Used by the SalesForce Translator.

To see a full list, see link:../admin/Deploying_VDB_Dependencies.adoc[Deploying VDB Dependencies]

If there’s not an available resource-adapter that meets your need, {{ book.productnameFull }} provides the framework for developing your own JEE JCA Connector. See the link:Developing_JEE_Connectors.adoc[Developing JEE Connectors] section, as it will describe how to develop, package and deploy a resource adapter.

== Other {{ book.productnameFull }} Development

{{ book.productnameFull }} is highly extensible in other ways:

* You may add User Defined Functions. Refer to link:User_Defined_Functions.adoc[User Defined Functions].

* You may adapt logging to your needs, which is especially useful for custom audit or command logging. Refer to link:Custom_Logging.adoc[Custom Logging].

* You may change the subsystem for custom authentication and authorization. Refer to link:../security/LoginModules.adoc#_custom_loginModules[Custom Login Modules].
