= Deploying the Adapter

Once the RAR file is built, deploy it by copying the RAR file into "deploy" directory of {{ book.asName }}’s chosen profile. Typically the server does not need to be restarted when a new RAR file is being added. Alternatively, you can also use "admin-console", a web based monitoring and configuration tool, to deploy this file into the container.

Once the Connector’s RAR file is deployed into the {{ book.asName }} container, now you can create an instance of this connector to be used with your Translator. Creating an instance of this Connector is no different than creating a "Connection Factory" in {{ book.asName }}. Again, you have two ways to create a ""ConnectionFactory".

Edit standalone.xml or domain.xml file, and add following XML in the "resource-adapters" subystem.

There are lot more properties that you can define for pooling, transactions, security, etc., in this file. Check the {{ book.asName }} documentation for all the available properties.

Alternatively, you can use the web based ""admin-console" configuration and monitoring program, to create a new Connection Factory. Have your RAR file name and needed configuration properties handy and fill out web form to create the ConnectionFactory.
