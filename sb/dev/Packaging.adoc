= Packaging

Once the "ExecutionFactory" class is implemented, package it in a JAR file. Then add the following named file in "META-INF/services/org.teiid.translator.ExecutionFactory" with contents specifying the name of your main Translator file. Note that, the name must exactly match to above. This is javaâ€™s standard service loader pattern. This will register the Translator for deployment when the jar is deployed into {{ book.asName }}.
