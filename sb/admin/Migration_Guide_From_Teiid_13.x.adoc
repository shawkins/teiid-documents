= Migration Guide From {{ book.productnameFull }} 13.x to 14.x

{{ book.productnameFull }} strives to maintain consistency between all versions, but when necessary breaking configuration and VDB/sql changes are made - and then typically only for major releases. 

You should consult the release notes for compatibility and configuration changes from each minor version that you are upgrading over.  This guide expands upon the release notes included in the kit to cover changes since 13.x.

If possible you should make your migration to {{ book.productnameFull }} 14 by first using {{ book.productnameFull }} 13.1.x.  {{ book.productnameFull }} 14 requires Java 8 and WildFly 19.1.  See also link:Migration_Guide_From_Teiid_12.x.adoc[12 to 13 Migration Guide]

== Configuration Changes

The mysql5 translator name has been deprecated.  Similar to the handling of other JDBC translators, the mysql translator now can handle MySQL 5 and later.
