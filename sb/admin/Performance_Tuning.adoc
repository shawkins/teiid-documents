= Performance Tuning

Performance tuning can be done by changing the property settings defined in the teiid subsystem and its sub components.

Execute the following command on CLI to see the possible settings at the root of the teiid subsystem:

----
/subsystem=teiid:read-resource-description
----

There are several categories of properties:

1.  Memory Management
2.  BufferManager: all properties that start with "buffer-service"
3.  Cache Tuning: all properties that start with "resultset-cache" or "preparedplan-cache"
4.  Threading
5.  LOBs
6.  Other Considerations

Socket Transport settings for one of the supported transport types (i.e., jdbc, odbc, embedded) can be viewed by executing the following command:

----
/subsystem=teiid/transport={jdbc | odbc | embedded}:read-resource-description
----
