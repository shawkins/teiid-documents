= Using {{ book.productnameFull }} with Hibernate

[id="client-dev-Using_Teiid_with_Hibernate-Configuration"]
== Configuration

For the most part, interacting with {{ book.productnameFull }} VDBs (Virtual Databases) through Hibernate is no different from working with any other type of data source.  First, depending on where your Hibernate application will reside, either in the same VM as the {{ book.productnameFull }} Runtime or on a separate VM, will determine which jar’s are used. 

* Running in same VM in the {{ book.asName }} server, then the teiid-client-\{version}.jar and teiid-hibernate-dialect-\{version}.jar already reside in <jboss-install>/modules/org/jboss/teiid/client
* Running separate VM’s,you need the {{ book.productnameFull }} JDBC Driver JAR and {{ book.productnameFull }}’s Hibernate Dialect JAR in the Hibernate’s classpath.  The Hibernate JAR can be found in <jboss-install>/modules/org/jboss/teiid/client, teiid-hibernate-dialect-\{version}.jar and the http://www.jboss.org/teiid/downloads.html[{{ book.productnameFull }} JDBC Driver JAR] needs to be downloaded.

These JAR files have the `org.teiid.dialect.TeiidDialect` and `org.teiid.jdbc.TeiidDriver` and `org.teiid.jdbc.TeiidDataSource` classes.

You configure Hibernate (via hibernate.cfg.xml) as follows:

* Specify the {{ book.productnameFull }} driver class in the `connection.driver_class` property:

[source,xml]
----
<property name="connection.driver_class">
     org.teiid.jdbc.TeiidDriver
</property>
----

* Specify the URL for the VDB in the `connection.url` property (replacing terms in angle brackets with the appropriate values):

[source,xml]
----
<property name="connection.url">
    jdbc:teiid:<vdb-name>@mm://<host>:<port>;user=<user-name>;password=<password>
</property>
----

TIP: Be sure to use a Local JDBC Connection if Hibernate is in the same VM as the application server.

* Specify the {{ book.productnameFull }} dialect class in the `dialect` property:

[source,xml]
----
<property name="dialect">
    org.teiid.dialect.TeiidDialect
</property>
----

Alternatively, if you put your connection properties in `hibernate.properties` instead of `hibernate.cfg.xml`, they would look like this:

[source,java]
----
hibernate.connection.driver_class=org.teiid.jdbc.TeiidDriver
hibernate.connection.url=jdbc:teiid:<vdb-name>@mm://<host>:<port>
hibernate.connection.username=<user-name>
hibernate.connection.password=<password>
hibernate.dialect=org.teiid.dialect.TeiidDialect
----

Note also that since your VDBs will likely contain multiple source and view models with identical table names, you will need to fully qualify table names specified in Hibernate mapping files:

[source,xml]
----
<class name="<Class name>" table="<Source/view model name>.[<schema name>.]<Table name>">
    ...
</class>
----

[source,xml]
.*Example Mapping*
----
<class name="org.teiid.example.Publisher" table="BOOKS.BOOKS.PUBLISHERS">
    ...
</class>
----

[id="client-dev-Using_Teiid_with_Hibernate-Identifier-Generation"]
== Identifier Generation

[id="client-dev-Using_Teiid_with_Hibernate-SEQUENCE-Based-Identity-Generation"]
=== SEQUENCE Based Identity Generation
If you want to use SEQUENCE based Identity generation with {{ book.productnameFull }}, you can do so through the {{ book.productnameFull }}Dialect. When you define a JPA Entity

----
public class Customer {
	@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.SEQUENCE, generator = "customer_generator")
	@SequenceGenerator(name="customer_generator", sequenceName = "customer_seq")
	@Id
	Long id;
}
----

In the {{ book.productnameFull }} VDB, define a virtual function as below example. Note, "_nextval" appended to the sequence name on the name of the function.

----
CREATE VIRTUAL FUNCTION customer_seq_nextval() RETURNS long
AS
BEGIN 
    -- Your code to retrieve the sequence from source database
    -- or generate one in {{ book.productnameFull }}.
END;
----

Given the above template, if for example you are working with Oracle would like to use the Oracle sequence you already defined as "customer_seq" in your Oracle database, then create View procedure in {{ book.productnameFull }} as

----
CREATE VIRTUAL FUNCTION customer_seq_nextval() RETURNS long
AS
BEGIN 
    SELECT OracleDB.mySequence_nextval();
END;
----

Stating with {{ book.productnameFull }} 10.0, for some sources, including DB2, Oracle, H2, PostgreSQL, DB2, you can automatically import sequence information.  For other sources you need to add source functions to represent the sequence calls.  For example assuming you wanted to do this manually for Oracle, then in your OracleDB source model, create a source function:

----
CREATE FOREIGN FUNCTION mySequence_nextval() RETURNS long
OPTIONS ("teiid_rel:native-query" 'SELECT customer_seq.NEXTVAL FROM dual', DETERMINISM 'NONDETERMINISTIC');
----

Then when the Customer entity is inserted, the sequence is used.

[id="client-dev-Using_Teiid_with_Hibernate-TABLE-Based-Idenity-Generation"]
=== TABLE Based Idenity Generation
If you want use TABLE based Identity generation with {{ book.productnameFull }}, you can do so through the {{ book.productnameFull }}Dialect. When you define a JPA Entity like

----
public class Customer {
	@TableGenerator(name = "customer", 
			table = "id_generator", 
			pkColumnName = "idkey", 
			valueColumnName = "idvalue", 
			pkColumnValue = "customer", 
			allocationSize = 1)
	@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.TABLE, generator = "customer")	
	@Id
	Long id;
	
	...
}
----

Then create a virtual table in {{ book.productnameFull }}'s view model as

----
CREATE VIEW id_generator (
	idkey string(255) NOT NULL,
	idvalue long,
	CONSTRAINT id_generatorPK PRIMARY KEY(idkey)
) OPTIONS (UPDATABLE TRUE)
AS
SELECT IDKEY, IDVALUE FROM OracleDB.IDGENERATOR;
----

Where in OracleDB, you have a physical Table called "IDGENERATOR" and with above shown columns. When you use this technique, please make sure you have seed content like below to begin with

----
INSERT INTO IDGENERATOR(IDKEY, IDVALUE) VALUES ('customer', 100);
----

such that the IDKEY matches and IDVALUE has a initializer value.

[id="client-dev-Using_Teiid_with_Hibernate-IDENTITY-Based-identity-generation"]
=== IDENTITY Based identity generation
* {{ book.productnameFull }} provides for GUID and Identity (using generated key retrieval) identifier generation strategy.

[id="client-dev-Using_Teiid_with_Hibernate-Limitations"]
== Limitations

* Many Hibernate use cases assume a data source has the ability (with proper user permissions) to process Data Definition Language (DDL) statements like CREATE TABLE and DROP TABLE as well as Data Manipulation Language (DML) statements like SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT and DELETE. {{ book.productnameFull }} can handle a broad range of DML, but does not directly handle DDL against a particular source.
* Sequence generation is not directly supported.
