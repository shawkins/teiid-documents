= OData V4 translator

The OData V4 translator, known by the type name _"odata4"_ exposes the OData Version 4 data sources and uses the {{ book.productnameFull }} 
web services resource adapter for making web service calls. 
This translator is extension of _Web Services Translator_. 
The OData V4 translator is not for use with older OData V1-3 sources. 
Use the OData translator (_"odata"_) for older OData sources.

.What is OData
The http://www.odata.org[Open Data Protocol (OData)] Web protocol is for querying and updating data that provides 
a way to unlock your data and free it from silos that exist in applications today. 
OData does this by applying and building upon Web technologies such as HTTP, Atom Publishing Protocol (AtomPub), 
and JSON to provide access to information from a variety of applications, services, and stores. 
OData is being used to expose and access information from a variety of sources including, but not limited to, 
relational databases, file systems, content management systems and traditional Web sites.

Using this specification from the OASIS group, with the help from the http://olingo.apache.org/[Olingo] framework, 
{{ book.productnameFull }} maps OData V4 CSDL (Conceptual Schema Definition Language) document from the OData endpoint 
provided and converts the OData metadata into {{ book.productnameFull }}â€™s relational schema. 
The following table shows the mapping selections in the OData V4 translator from a CSDL document

.Using OData as a server
NOTE: {{ book.productnameFull }} can not only consume OData-based data sources, but it can expose any data source as an OData based web service. 
For more information see _OData Support_ in the http://teiid.github.io/teiid-documents/master/sb/client-dev/Client_Developers_Guide.html[Client Developer's Guide].

|OData |Mapped to relational entity

|EntitySet
|Table

|EntityType
|Table see [1]

|ComplexType
|Table see [2]

|FunctionImport
|Procedure [3]

|ActionImport
|Procedure [3]

|NavigationProperties
|Table [4]

|===

[1] Only if the EntityType is exposed as the EntitySet in the Entity container. 
[2] Only if the complex type is used as property in the exposed EntitySet. This table will be designed as child table 
with foreign key [1-to-1] or [1-to-many] relationship to the parent. +
[3] If the return type is EntityType or ComplexType, the procedure is designed to return a table. 
[4] Navigation properties are exposed as tables. The table will be created with foreign key relationship to the parent.

All CRUD operations will be appropriately mapped to the resulting entity based on the SQL submitted to the OData translator.

.Usage

Usage of a OData source is similar a JDBC translator. 
The metadata import is supported through the translator, once the metadata is imported from source system and exposed in relational terms, 
then this source can be queried as if the EntitySets, Function Imports and Action Imports were local to the {{ book.productnameFull }} system.

It is not recommended to define your own metadata using {{ book.productnameFull }} DDL for complex services.
There are several extension metadata properties required to enable proper functioning. 
On non-string properties, a `NATIVE_TYPE` property is expected and should specify the full EDM type name - `Edm.xxx`.  

The below is sample VDB that can read metadata service from TripPin service on http://odata.org[http://odata.org] site.

[source,xml]
----
<vdb name="trippin" version="1">
    <model name="trippin">
         <source name="odata4" translator-name="odata4" connection-jndi-name="java:/tripDS"/>
    </model>
</vdb>
----

{% if book.targetWildfly %}
The required resource-adapter configuration will look like

[source,xml]
----
<resource-adapter id="trippin">
    <module slot="main" id="org.jboss.teiid.resource-adapter.webservice"/>
    <transaction-support>NoTransaction</transaction-support>
    <connection-definitions>
        <connection-definition class-name="org.teiid.resource.adapter.ws.WSManagedConnectionFactory" jndi-name="java:/tripDS" enabled="true" use-java-context="true" pool-name="teiid-trip-ds">
            <config-property name="EndPoint">
                http://services.odata.org/V4/(S(va3tkzikqbtgu1ist44bbft5))/TripPinServiceRW
            </config-property>
        </connection-definition>
    </connection-definitions>
</resource-adapter>
----
{% endif %}

You can connect to the VDB deployed using {{ book.productnameFull }} JDBC driver and issue SQL statements like

[source,sql]
----
SELECT * FROM trippin.People;
SELECT * FROM trippin.People WHERE UserName = 'russelwhyte';
SELECT * FROM trippin.People p INNER JOIN trippin.People_Friends pf ON p.UserName = pf.People_UserName; (note that People_UserName is implicitly added by {{ book.productnameFull }} metadata)
EXEC GetNearestAirport(lat, lon) ;
----

.Configuration of translator

.Execution properties

Sometimes default properties need to adjusted for proper execution of the translator.
The following execution properties extend or limit the functionality of the translator based on the physical source capabilities.  

|===
|Name |Description |Default

|SupportsOdataCount
|Supports $count
|true

|SupportsOdataFilter
|Supports $filter
|true

|SupportsOdataOrderBy
|Supports $orderby
|true

|SupportsOdataSkip
|Supports $skip
|true

|SupportsOdataTop
|Supports $top
|true

|SupportsUpdates
|Supports INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE
|true

|===

The OData server that you connect to might not fully implement the entire 
OData specification. If the server's OData implementation does not support a feature, 
set "execution properties" to turn off the corresponding capability, so that {{ book.productnameFull }} 
does not push down invalid queries to the translator. 


[source,xml]
----
<translator name="odata-override" type="odata">
     <property name="SupportsOdataFilter" value="false"/>
</translator>
----

then use "odata-override" as the translator name on your source model.

.Importer properties
The following table lists the importer properties that define the behavior of the translator during metadata import from the physical source.

|===
|Name |Description |Default

|schemaNamespace
|Namespace of the schema to import
|null

|===

Example importer settings to only import tables and views from http://services.odata.org/V4/(S(nivess3y23eyhit4jbppgtdj))/TripPinServiceRW/$metadata[Trippin] 
service exposed on odata.org

[source,xml]
----
<property name="importer.schemaNamespace" value="Microsoft.OData.SampleService.Models.TripPin"/>
----

You can leave this property undefined. If the translator does not detect a configured instance of the property, 
it specifies the default name of the EntityContainer.

{% if book.targetWildfly %}
.JCA resource adapter

The resource adapter for this translator is a link:../admin/Web_Service_Data_Sources.adoc[Web Service Data Source].
{% endif %}

TIP: *Native queries* - Native or direct query execution is not supported through the OData translator. 
However, you can use the _invokehttp_ method of the Web services translator to issue REST-based calls, and then use SQLXML to parse results.
