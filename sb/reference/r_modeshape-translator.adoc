The ModeShape Translator, known by the type name *_modeshape_*, is for use with Modeshape 2.2.1 or later.

== Usage

The PATH, NAME, LOCALNODENAME, DEPTH, and SCORE functions should be accessed as pseudo-columns, e.g. "nt:base"."jcr:path".

{{ book.productnameFull }} UFDs (prefixed by JCR_) are available for CONTIANS, ISCHILDNODE, ISDESCENDENT, ISSAMENODE, REFERENCE - see the JCRFunctions.xmi. If a selector name is needed in a JCR function, you should use the pseudo-column "jcr:path", e.g. JCR_ISCHILDNODE(foo.jcr_path, 'x/y') would become ISCHILDNODE(foo, `x/y') in the ModeShape query.

An additional pseudo-column "mode:properties" should be imported by setting the ModeShape JDBC connection property teiidsupport=true. The column "mode:properties" should be used by the JCR_REFERENCE and other functions that expect a .* selector name, e.g. JCR_REFERENCE(nt_base.jcr_properties) would become REFERENCE("nt:base".*) in the ModeShape query.
