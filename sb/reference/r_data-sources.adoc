This represents data sources that have been validated to work using the available translators and connectors. However, this does not preclude a new data source from working. It can be as easy as extending an existing translator, to creating a new translator using the link:../dev/Translator_Development.adoc[Translator Development] extensions.

Take a look at the list of link:as_translators.adoc[Translators] that are used as the bridge between {{ book.productnameFull }} and the external system.
