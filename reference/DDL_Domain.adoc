= DDL Metadata for Domains

Domains are simple type declarations that define a set of valid values for a given type name.  They can be created at the database level only.

{% if book.targetWildfly %}
The DDL for domains is common to both link:xml_deployment_mode.adoc[XML] and link:ddl_deployment_mode.adoc[DDL] VDBs.  
However in an XML vdb domains must be defined in a VDB property "domain-ddl".
{% endif %} 

== Create Domain

[source,sql]
----
CREATE DOMAIN <Domain name> [ AS ] <data type>
     [ [NOT] NULL ]
----

The domain name may any non-keyword identifier.

See the BNF for <<../reference/BNF_for_SQL_Grammar.adoc#parseDataTypePrimary, Data Types>>

Once a domain is defined it may be referenced as the data type for a column, parameter, etc.

DDL VDB Example
[source,sql]
----
CREATE DOMAIN mychar AS VARCHAR(1000);

CREATE VIRTUAL SCHEMA viewLayer;
SET SCHEMA viewLayer;
CREATE VIEW v1 (col1 mychar) as select 'value';
...
----

XML VDB Example
[source,xml]
----
<vdb name="Portfolio" version="1">

    <property name="domain-ddl" value="CREATE DOMAIN ssn AS VARCHAR(9); CREATE DOMAIN myint AS integer not null;" />
    ...
----

When the system metadata is queried the type for the column will be shown as the domain name.

== Limitations

Domain names are not yet recognized in every place that a data type is expected, such as in:

* create temp table 
* execute immediate
* arraytable
* objecttable
* texttable
* xmltable

The ODBC/pg metadata will show the base type name, rather than the domain name when querying pg_attribute.
