= Sybase Translator (sybase)

The Sybase Translator, known by the type name *_sybase_*, is for use with Sybase version 12.5 or later.

If using the the default native import and no import properties are specified (not recommended, see import properties below), then exceptions can be thrown retrieving system table information. You should specify a schemaName, or schemaPattern, or use excludeTables to exclude system tables if this occurs.

If the name in source metadata contains quoted identifiers (such as required by reserved words or words containing characters that would not otherwise be allowed) and you are using a jconnect Sybase driver, you must first configure the connection pool to enable *quoted_identifier*:

Driver URL with SQLINITSTRING

[source,sql]
----
jdbc:sybase:Tds:host.at.some.domain:5000/db_name?SQLINITSTRING=set quoted_identifier on
----

If you are a jconnect Sybase driver and will target the source for dependent joins, you should allow the translator to send more values by setting the JCONNECT_VERSION. Otherwise you will get exceptions with statements that have more than 481 bind values:

Driver URL with JCONNECT_VERSION

[source,sql]
----
jdbc:sybase:Tds:host.at.some.domain:5000/db_name?SQLINITSTRING=set quoted_identifier on&JCONNECT_VERSION=6

Sybase specific execution properties:

* _JtdsDriver_- indicates that the open source JTDS driver is being used. Defaults to false.
